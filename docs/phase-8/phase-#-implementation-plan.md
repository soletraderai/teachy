# Phase [N] Implementation Plan: [Feature/Project Name]

<!--
=============================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TEMPLATE - INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENTS
=============================================================================

PURPOSE:
This document translates user feedback into a strategic implementation approach.
It is created by an agent and requires USER APPROVAL before proceeding.

WORKFLOW POSITION:
This file is Step 2 of 4 in the phase workflow:
  1. FEEDBACK → User writes (INPUT for this document)
  2. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (this file) → Agent creates, user approves
  3. TASKS → Agent creates from this plan, user approves
  4. SESSION NOTES → Agent updates during execution

See README.md for the complete workflow documentation.

AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:

Before writing this plan:
1. Read `phase-#-feedback.md` thoroughly - understand ALL feedback items
2. Read `README.md` to understand the workflow
3. Analyze the codebase to understand current implementation
4. Identify patterns, conventions, and constraints

When writing this plan:
1. Address EVERY item from the feedback file
2. Be specific about the approach - vague plans lead to vague results
3. Define rules/guidelines that maintain consistency
4. Break implementation into logical sub-phases (completable in 1-2 sessions each)
5. Include measurable success metrics

After writing:
1. Present the plan to the user for approval
2. DO NOT proceed to task creation until user approves
3. Be prepared to revise based on user feedback

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:
Once this plan is approved, another agent will:
1. Review this implementation plan
2. Create granular tasks in `phase-#-tasks.md`
3. Present tasks for user approval before execution begins

## 1. Vision & Philosophy

**Goal:** [One-line description of what this phase will achieve]

[2-3 sentences expanding on the goal and explaining the "why" behind this phase]

### Guiding Principles
<!--
Define 3-5 rules that will guide all decisions in this phase.
These should be memorable and actionable.
-->
1. **[Principle Name]:** [Description and why it matters]
2. **[Principle Name]:** [Description and why it matters]
3. **[Principle Name]:** [Description and why it matters]
4. **[Principle Name]:** [Description and why it matters]
5. **[Principle Name]:** [Description and why it matters]

---

## 2. Technical Specifications

<!--
Capture technical details that will be referenced throughout implementation.
Adapt subsections based on what's relevant for this phase.
-->

### A. [Specification Area 1] (e.g., Color Palette, API Structure, Data Schema)

| [Column 1] | [Column 2] | [Column 3] | [Column 4] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Value] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] |
| [Value] | [Value] | [Value] | [Value] |

### B. [Specification Area 2] (e.g., Typography, Endpoints, State Management)

* **[Item]:** [Description]
* **[Item]:** [Description]
* **[Item]:** [Description]

### C. [Specification Area 3] (e.g., Patterns, Conventions)

[Detailed explanation of patterns or conventions to follow]

---

## 3. Component/Feature Breakdown

<!--
Break down the major components or features that will be built/modified.
Include specific details about structure, behavior, and interactions.
-->

### A. [Component/Feature 1]

* **Structure:** [How it's organized]
* **Behavior:** [How it works]
* **Interaction:** [How users interact with it]

### B. [Component/Feature 2]

* **Structure:** [How it's organized]
* **Behavior:** [How it works]
* **Interaction:** [How users interact with it]

### C. [Component/Feature 3]

* **Visual:** [What it looks like]
* **Interaction:** [How users interact with it]

---

## 4. Implementation Phases

<!--
Break implementation into logical sub-phases.
Each sub-phase should be completable in 1-2 coding sessions.
These become the basis for the detailed task list.
-->

### Phase [N].1: [Foundation/Setup]
- [ ] [High-level task description]
- [ ] [High-level task description]
- [ ] [High-level task description]

### Phase [N].2: [Core Feature 1]
- [ ] [High-level task description]
- [ ] [High-level task description]
- [ ] [High-level task description]

### Phase [N].3: [Core Feature 2]
- [ ] [High-level task description]
- [ ] [High-level task description]
- [ ] [High-level task description]

### Phase [N].4: [Polish/Integration]
- [ ] [High-level task description]
- [ ] [High-level task description]
- [ ] [High-level task description]

## 5. Success Metrics

<!--
Define 3-5 measurable outcomes that indicate the phase was successful.
These should map back to the acceptance criteria in the feedback file.
-->

- **[Metric 1]:** [How you'll know this was achieved]
- **[Metric 2]:** [How you'll know this was achieved]
- **[Metric 3]:** [How you'll know this was achieved]

---

## 6. Feedback Coverage

<!--
Map each feedback item to where it's addressed in this plan.
Ensures nothing from the feedback file is missed.
-->

| Feedback Item | Addressed In |
|---------------|--------------|
| [Feedback 1 summary] | Phase [N].X |
| [Feedback 2 summary] | Phase [N].X |
| [Feedback 3 summary] | Phase [N].X |
