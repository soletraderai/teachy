# Phase [N] Session Notes

<!--
=============================================================================
SESSION NOTES TEMPLATE - INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENTS
=============================================================================

PURPOSE:
This is the living record of implementation progress. It captures findings,
changes, and outcomes as work progresses. Updated CONTINUOUSLY during execution.

WORKFLOW POSITION:
This file is Step 4 of 4 in the phase workflow:
  1. FEEDBACK → User writes
  2. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN → Agent creates, user approves
  3. TASKS → Agent creates, user approves
  4. SESSION NOTES (this file) → Agent updates during execution

See README.md for the complete workflow documentation.

WHY SESSION NOTES MATTER:
- Enables seamless handoff between sessions/agents
- Prevents re-investigating the same issues
- Provides audit trail of all changes
- Documents the "why" behind decisions
- Proves what was tested and verified

AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:

When to update:
- At the START of each coding session
- After completing each sub-phase from the task list
- When discovering important findings
- After applying fixes or making changes
- After testing (pass or fail)
- At the END of each session (summary)

What to document:
1. KEY FINDINGS - What you discovered during investigation
2. CHANGES MADE - Specific changes with file paths and line numbers
3. TESTING RESULTS - What was tested, pass/fail status
4. SUMMARY - Overall status at session end

Best practices:
- Update IN REAL-TIME as you work, not at the end
- Be specific with file paths and line numbers
- Include actual values, not just "it was wrong"
- Reference screenshots for UI issues
- If unresolved, document what to try next

STRUCTURE:
- Create a new "Session" section for each coding session
- Each session should have: Date, Work Done, Findings, Summary
- Keep previous sessions for history (don't delete)
