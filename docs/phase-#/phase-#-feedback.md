# Phase [N] Feedback - [Phase Title]

<!--
=============================================================================
FEEDBACK TEMPLATE - INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
=============================================================================

PURPOSE:
This is the STARTING POINT for every phase. The user (Product Owner) documents
feedback, issues, and requirements here after reviewing the application.

WORKFLOW POSITION:
This file is Step 1 of 4 in the phase workflow:
  1. FEEDBACK (this file) → User writes
  2. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN → Agent creates from feedback, user approves
  3. TASKS → Agent creates from plan, user approves
  4. SESSION NOTES → Agent updates during execution

See README.md for the complete workflow documentation.

HOW TO USE THIS FILE:

1. OVERVIEW SECTION
   - Provide a brief summary of what this phase addresses
   - Set priority and note any dependencies

2. FEEDBACK SECTIONS
   - Organize feedback by category/area of the application
   - Each item should describe: current behavior vs. desired behavior
   - Be specific - vague feedback leads to misunderstandings

3. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
   - Define what "done" looks like
   - These become the validation checklist at phase end

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:
Once feedback is complete, an agent will:
1. Review this file thoroughly
2. Analyze the codebase to understand current implementation
3. Create the implementation plan (phase-#-implementation-plan.md)
4. Present the plan for your approval

**Overview**
[Provide a 2-3 sentence overview of this phase. What is the goal? Why is it needed? What will success look like?]

**Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Dependencies:** [List any prerequisites or blockers]

## Feedback

<!--
Organize feedback by category/area of the application.
Each item should describe the issue or requested change clearly.
Include current behavior vs. desired behavior where relevant.
-->

### [Category 1] (e.g., Session, Dashboard, Navigation)
- [Feedback item 1 - describe the issue or requested change]
- [Feedback item 2]
- [Feedback item 3]

### [Category 2] (e.g., Questions, User Experience, Performance)
- [Feedback item 1]
- [Feedback item 2]
- [Feedback item 3]

### [Category 3] (e.g., Data, API, Backend)
- [Feedback item 1]
- [Feedback item 2]

## Acceptance Criteria

<!--
Define what "done" looks like for this phase.
These should be testable/observable outcomes.
The implementing agent will verify these at phase completion.
-->

- [ ] [Criterion 1 - specific, testable outcome]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]
- [ ] [Criterion 4]
