# QuizTube (formerly Teachy) - Progress Notes

## Phase 3 Progress - COMPLETE! 100% (176/176)

### Session 8 - January 13, 2026 (Regression Testing & CORS Fix)

**Regression Testing Completed:**
- All servers verified running (localhost:5173 frontend, localhost:3001 proxy)
- Tested 3 randomly selected features for regression:

1. ✅ **Feature 809: URL validation - Prevent invalid submission**
   - Entered invalid URL: "not-a-valid-url"
   - Submission was blocked (stayed on same page)
   - Error message shown: "Please enter a URL."

2. ✅ **Feature 775: Context code editor - Store preference**
   - Verified localStorage key `quiztube_show_code_editor` exists
   - Preference persists across page refresh
   - Toggle functionality implemented correctly in ActiveSession.tsx

3. ✅ **Feature 823: Learning paths - Create goal**
   - Navigated to Goals page
   - Clicked "Create Goal" button
   - Completed 4-step wizard (Goal Type → Define Goal → Deadline → Review)
   - Created "Learn React" topic goal with target of 5 topics
   - UI flow works correctly (API errors expected without full backend)

**Bug Found & Fixed:**
- 🐛 CORS errors when Vite uses alternate port (5175 instead of 5173)
  - Error: "The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'http://localhost:5173' that is not equal to the supplied origin"
- ✅ Fixed by updating server.js CORS configuration to accept any localhost port
  - Changed from hardcoded `origin: 'http://localhost:5173'` to dynamic function
  - Now accepts any `http://localhost:\d+` origin for development

**Files Modified:**
- server.js (CORS configuration - dynamic localhost port support)

**Status:** Phase 3 is fully complete and stable (176/176 features passing).
No `phase4_spec.txt` exists - waiting for detailed Phase 4 specification.
