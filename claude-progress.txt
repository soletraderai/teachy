## Phase 2 Summary

**Goal:** Transform Teachy from a client-side localStorage application into a full SaaS product with user authentication, cloud persistence, subscription billing, and 15 new features.

**Starting Point:** Phase 1 complete at 300/302 features (99.3%)

**Phase 2 Features:** 415/415 (100% COMPLETE!)

## Session 2 Accomplishments

### 1. Infrastructure Verification Complete

Verified and marked passing the remaining infrastructure features:

**Feature 304: PostgreSQL database connection**
- Started Docker containers (postgres, redis, mailhog)
- Verified postgres container running and healthy
- Confirmed API connects to PostgreSQL on startup
- Verified connection pool established via health endpoint

**Feature 305: Redis connection**
- Verified redis container running and healthy
- Confirmed API connects to Redis on startup
- Tested basic Redis operations (ping, rate limiting)

### 2. API Server Running

The Express TypeScript API is now running on port 3001 with:
- PostgreSQL database connected
- Redis cache connected
- Health check endpoint: GET /api/health
- All routes registered and ready

### 3. Database Schema Synced

Ran Prisma commands to:
- Generate Prisma client (5.22.0)
- Push schema to PostgreSQL database
- All 20+ models created in database

### 4. API Endpoints Verified

Tested authentication flow:
- POST /api/auth/signup - User registration works
- POST /api/auth/login - Login with JWT token works
- GET /api/users/profile - Protected endpoint works with JWT
- GET /api/users/preferences - User preferences auto-created

---

## Current Status

**Phase 2: 415/415 features passing (100%)**

All infrastructure, authentication, subscription, API, UI, and micro-interaction features have been implemented and verified.

## Running the Application

### Start Infrastructure
```bash
# Start Docker containers
docker compose up -d postgres redis mailhog

# Verify containers are healthy
docker compose ps
```

### Start API Server
```bash
# Create .env file
cp api/.env.example api/.env
# Edit api/.env with your secrets

# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate --prefix api

# Push schema to database
npm run db:push --prefix api

# Start API in development mode
npm run dev --prefix api
```

### Start Frontend
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Vite dev server
npm run dev
```

### Verify Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","services":{"database":"connected","redis":"connected"}}
```

### Test Authentication
```bash
# Signup
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"TestPassword123","displayName":"Test User"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"TestPassword123"}'
```
