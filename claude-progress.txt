### Features Skipped (Dependency on Session Creation)

The following features were skipped because they require YouTube API integration and session creation functionality which is not yet implemented:
- Features 4, 6-36: Session creation, overview, active session, questions, feedback, etc.
- Features 54-55, 58-69, 71-76, 78-79: Various session-dependent features

---

## Current State

### What's Working Well
- All navigation between pages functions correctly
- Settings form with full validation and persistence
- Security measures (XSS prevention, URL injection protection, masked API key)
- localStorage persistence with graceful corruption recovery
- 404 page for invalid routes
- Empty states displayed appropriately
- Neobrutalism design renders beautifully across all pages
- Cancel button with unsaved changes confirmation dialog

### What Needs Implementation

**Critical (Blocking Most Features):**
1. **YouTube API Integration** - Extract transcripts and metadata from YouTube URLs
2. **Gemini AI Integration** - Generate questions and evaluate answers
3. **Session Creation Flow** - Create and store learning sessions

Once these are implemented, approximately 200+ features can be tested.

## Feature Progress

- **Total Features**: 302
- **Passing**: 49
- **Completion**: 16.2%

## Running the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Or use the init script
./init.sh
```

The application is running at http://localhost:5175 (port may vary)

## Notes for Next Agent

### Testing Approach
- Use Playwright browser automation to verify features
- Take screenshots for visual verification
- Check console for errors after each test
- Test both happy paths and error cases

### Feature Dependencies
Most remaining features (70%+) depend on session creation. The next agent should focus on implementing:
1. YouTube transcript extraction service
2. Gemini AI question generation
3. Session state management flow

### Key Files
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - URL input and session creation trigger
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx` - User settings (fully working)
- `src/stores/settingsStore.ts` - Settings state management
- `src/stores/sessionStore.ts` - Session state management (needs enhancement)
- `src/services/` - Place for API integration services

### Neobrutalism Design
The design system is fully implemented with:
- Hard black borders (3px)
- Offset shadows (4-8px)
- Electric yellow (#FFDE59) buttons
- Cyan (#00D4FF) accents
- Sharp corners (no border-radius)

**Critical**: Do NOT modify the features database. Features can only be marked as passing, never edited or deleted.
