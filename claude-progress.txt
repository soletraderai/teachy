### Features Skipped (Session-Dependent)

Many features were skipped because they require YouTube/Gemini API integration:
- 148: Answer field validation
- 154-156: Session completion feedback, video processing, answer evaluation
- 159-160: Progress feedback, bookmark confirmation
- 165, 167-169: Library grid, long text, session responsiveness
- 175, 179-186: Images alt text, progress screen readers, timestamps, sorting

## Current State

### What's Working Well
- All navigation between pages functions correctly
- Settings form with full validation and persistence
- Security measures (XSS prevention, URL injection protection, masked API key)
- localStorage persistence with graceful corruption recovery
- 404 page for invalid routes
- Empty states displayed appropriately
- Neobrutalism design renders beautifully across all pages
- Mobile responsive design with hamburger menu
- Toast notifications with auto-dismiss and manual dismiss
- Tab navigation accessibility
- All form validations with specific error messages

### What Needs Implementation

**Critical (Blocking Most Features):**
1. **YouTube API Integration** - Extract transcripts and metadata from YouTube URLs
2. **Gemini AI Integration** - Generate questions and evaluate answers
3. **Session Creation Flow** - Create and store learning sessions

The services are scaffolded in `src/services/` but need real API integration.

## Feature Progress

- **Total Features**: 302
- **Passing**: 165
- **Completion**: 54.6%

## Running the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Or use the init script
./init.sh
```

The application is running at http://localhost:5175 (port may vary)

## Notes for Next Agent

### Testing Approach
- Use Playwright browser automation to verify features
- Take screenshots for visual verification
- Check console for errors after each test
- Test both happy paths and error cases

### Feature Dependencies
Most remaining features (47%) depend on session creation. The next agent should focus on implementing:
1. YouTube transcript extraction service
2. Gemini AI question generation
3. Session state management flow

### Key Files
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - URL input and session creation trigger (updated with createSession integration)
- `src/pages/Settings.tsx` - User settings (fully working)
- `src/pages/ActiveSession.tsx` - Active learning session (updated with Gemini integration)
- `src/stores/settingsStore.ts` - Settings state management
- `src/stores/sessionStore.ts` - Session state management
- `src/services/session.ts` - Session creation service
- `src/services/youtube.ts` - YouTube API service
- `src/services/gemini.ts` - Gemini AI service

### Neobrutalism Design
The design system is fully implemented with:
- Hard black borders (3px)
- Offset shadows (4-8px)
- Electric yellow (#FFDE59) buttons
- Cyan (#00D4FF) accents
- Sharp corners (no border-radius)

**Critical**: Do NOT modify the features database. Features can only be marked as passing, never edited or deleted.
