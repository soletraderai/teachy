### 2. Project Structure Created
```
/src
  /components
    /ui          - Button, Input, Card, Select, Toast, ProgressBar, Layout
    /session     - (placeholder for session components)
    /library     - (placeholder for library components)
    /settings    - (placeholder for settings components)
  /hooks         - (placeholder for custom hooks)
  /services      - (placeholder for API services)
  /types         - Full TypeScript type definitions
  /utils         - (placeholder for utilities)
  /stores        - Zustand stores for settings and sessions
  /pages         - All main page components
```

### 3. Core Components Implemented
- **UI Components**: Button, Input, Card, Select, Toast, ProgressBar, Layout
- **Pages**: Home, Settings, Library, SessionOverview, ActiveSession, SessionNotes, NotFound
- **Stores**: settingsStore (user settings), sessionStore (sessions/library)
- **Types**: Complete TypeScript definitions for all data models

### 4. Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite bundler configuration
- `tailwind.config.js` - Neobrutalism design system tokens
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `eslint.config.js` - Linting configuration
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS for Tailwind

### 5. Design System
- Implemented neobrutalism CSS variables
- Colors: Electric yellow primary (#FFDE59), Cyan secondary (#00D4FF)
- Hard black borders (3px), offset shadows (4-8px)
- Typography: Space Grotesk (headings), Inter (body), JetBrains Mono (code)
- Utility classes: brutal-border, brutal-shadow, brutal-card, brutal-button

### 6. Git Repository
- Initialized git repository
- Created initial commit with all project files

---

## What's Working
- Basic routing between all pages
- Settings page with form validation
- Library page with search and filters
- Session notes display
- Active session flow (question → feedback → summary)
- Progress tracking
- Zustand state persistence to localStorage

---

## What Needs Implementation (For Future Agents)

### High Priority (Core Functionality)
1. **YouTube API Integration**
   - Transcript extraction
   - Video metadata fetching
   - URL validation and parsing

2. **Gemini AI Integration**
   - Question generation from transcript
   - Answer evaluation and feedback
   - Topic extraction

3. **Knowledge Base Building**
   - GitHub API integration
   - Documentation fetching
   - Source snippet extraction

4. **Dig Deeper Mode**
   - Conversational chat interface
   - Additional question generation

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)
5. Form validation improvements
6. Error boundary implementation
7. Loading state improvements
8. Session recovery for interrupted sessions

### Lower Priority (Polish)
9. Export session notes
10. Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, screen reader testing)
11. Mobile responsiveness testing
12. Performance optimization

---

## Running the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Or use the init script
./init.sh
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173

## Feature Progress

- **Total Features**: 302
- **Passing**: 0
- **Completion**: 0%

The next agent should:
1. Run `feature_get_next` to get the highest priority feature
2. Implement the feature
3. Test it manually or with browser automation
4. Mark as passing with `feature_mark_passing`
5. Repeat until context limit

---

## Notes for Next Agent

- The project uses Vite for fast HMR during development
- State is persisted to localStorage via Zustand middleware
- The neobrutalism design system is defined in `tailwind.config.js` and `src/index.css`
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- All data models are in `src/types/index.ts`
- The stores handle all state management - avoid prop drilling

**Critical**: Do NOT modify the features database. Features can only be marked as passing, never edited or deleted.
