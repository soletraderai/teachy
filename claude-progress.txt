## Session 4 Accomplishments

### Features Verified This Session (8 new passing)

**Style Features:**
208. Video thumbnail displays correctly - Thumbnails load from YouTube, proper aspect ratio, no stretching
209. Progress bar styling - Chunky h-6 bar, primary yellow fill, hard 3px black border
210. Input field styling - Hard borders, no soft shadows, visible focus state with brutal shadow

**Functional Features:**
213. YouTube URL with timestamp handled - URLs with &t=120 parameters work correctly
214. YouTube URL various formats - youtube.com/watch, youtu.be, and youtube.com/embed all work
215. Language selector saves preference - Language selection persists after page refresh
216. Session can be ended at any point - End Session Early button available throughout session
221. Score updates in real-time - Completed/Skipped/Answered/Bookmarked counts all accurate

### Features Skipped (Dependency/Not Implemented)

- 212: Chat interface styling - Dig Deeper mode not fully implemented
- 217: Multiple questions per topic - UI only shows one question per topic (data model supports it)
- 218: Source snippets clickable - Knowledge base sources not populated
- 219: Dig deeper uses context - Dig Deeper mode not implemented
- 220: Feedback references knowledge base - Knowledge base not populated

---

## Current State

### What's Working Well
- Session creation with YouTube video metadata (oEmbed API)
- Fallback topic generation when Gemini API key is invalid
- Thumbnail display in library, session overview, and session notes
- Progress bar with neobrutalism styling
- All YouTube URL formats supported (watch, youtu.be, embed, with timestamps)
- Language preference persistence
- Session ending at any point in the flow
- Real-time score tracking (completed, skipped, answered, bookmarked)
- All neobrutalism styling verified (borders, shadows, colors, typography)

### What Still Needs Work

**Partially Implemented:**
1. **Multiple Questions per Topic** - Data model has 2 questions per topic, but UI only presents 1
2. **Dig Deeper Mode** - Service exists but UI shows "coming soon" toast

**Not Implemented:**
1. **Knowledge Base** - Sources array always empty (would require GitHub/documentation scraping)
2. **Full Gemini Integration** - Works with valid API key, gracefully degrades with fallback

## Feature Progress

- **Total Features**: 302
- **Passing**: 209
- **Completion**: 69.2%

## Running the Project

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Or use the init script
./init.sh
```

The application is running at http://localhost:5173 (port may vary)

## Notes for Next Agent

### Testing Approach
- Use Playwright browser automation to verify features
- Take screenshots for visual verification
- Check console for errors after each test
- Test both happy paths and error cases
- Create sessions by entering real YouTube URLs

### Session Creation Flow (Working)
1. Enter YouTube URL on home page
2. Click "Start Learning"
3. Video metadata fetched via oEmbed API
4. Topics generated (via Gemini or fallback)
5. Session saved to localStorage
6. Navigate to session overview

### Key Files
- `src/pages/Home.tsx` - URL input and session creation (integrated with services)
- `src/pages/ActiveSession.tsx` - Active learning session (integrated with Gemini)
- `src/pages/Library.tsx` - Session library with thumbnails and search
- `src/pages/SessionNotes.tsx` - Completed session notes with scores
- `src/services/session.ts` - Session creation orchestration
- `src/services/youtube.ts` - YouTube oEmbed API integration
- `src/services/gemini.ts` - Gemini AI integration with fallback

### Features Likely to Pass Next
- Session overview displays topics
- Topics list shows count
- Session notes show Q&A history
- Bookmark toggle works
- Skip button works

**Critical**: Do NOT modify the features database. Features can only be marked as passing, never edited or deleted.
